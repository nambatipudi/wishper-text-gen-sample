 I have the pleasure to present to you Dr. Martin Luther King. Yeah! I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the emancipation proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination one hundred years later. The Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity one hundred years later. The Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. In the architects of our republic, wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. They were signing a promise or a note to whichever American was to fall out. This note was a promise at all men. Yes, black men as well as white men. To be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and a pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promise or a note in so far as her citizens of color or concern. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check or check which has come back mark insufficient funds. But we refuse to believe that the Bank of Justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that our insufficient funds and the great bolts of opportunity of this nation. And so we've come to cash this check or check that will give us a pun demand, the riches of freedom and the security of justice. We have also come to this hell of spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sense of racial independence. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children. It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negroes legitimate discontent will not pass until that is an invigorating autumn of the nation. The freedom and equality. 1963 is not an end but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. The Negroes will be neither rest nor tranquillity in America until the Negroes granted his citizenship rights. The world wins and the revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. But that is something that I must say to my people who stand on the wrong threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongfully and ungrateful. In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongfully and ungrateful. In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongfully and ungrateful. Let us not seek the sight of fire first for freedom by drinking from the cup of fiddles and hints. We must fail for the last struggle on the high flame of kicks and khandism. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. We can't end again. We must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force for soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has endowed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people. We may have our white folks as evidenced by their presence here today. And from the real life of that density of our lives. If I'm realized that freedom is in its strictly bound to our freedom, we cannot walk alone. As we walk, we must make the plans that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights. When will you be satisfied? We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is a good fit for all the young, spiritual horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied. As long as our body and religion was a particular travel. They're not getting larger in the more chaos in the highways than the whole chaos with the city. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro in Mississippi cannot vote. And the Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty street. I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from now a jail sale. Some of you have come from areas where your press quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution. And staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that online suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi. Go back to Alabama. Go back to South Carolina. Go back to Georgia. Go back to Louisiana. Go back to the slums and get holes in our northern cities. Knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you today, my friends. So even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created. I have a dream that one day on the Red Hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners, will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips tripping with the words of interposition and nullification. One day right down in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valor shall be exalted. Every hill in mounting shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the goal of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together. This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith, we will be able to hue out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day. This will be the day. This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning my country tears of thee. Sweet land of liberty of the icing, land where my father's died, land of the pilgrim's pride. From every mountain side, let freedom reign in the Americas to be a great nation. This must become true. So let freedom reign from the prodigious hill tops of New Hampshire. Let freedom reign from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom reign from the heightening alligators of Pennsylvania. Let freedom reign from the snow cap Rockers of Colorado. Let freedom reign from the crevice of slopes of California. But not only that, let freedom reign from stone mountain of Georgia. Let freedom reign from look out mountain of Tennessee. Let freedom reign from every hill and whole hill of Mississippi. From every mountain side, let freedom reign and when this happens. When we allow freedom reign, when we let it reign from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city. We will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics. We'll be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual. To create last, create last, take God Almighty, we'll create last.

Summary:
Martin Luther King Jr. signed emancipation proclamation five years ago.
This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves.
The proclamation was signed by a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today.
It was a joyous daybreak to end the struggle for freedom in the history of the United States, he says.
He says it was a daybreak for freedom, not an end of war.
"It was the greatest demonstration for freedom," says King.
She says it is now a holiday for slaves in which he stands in the shadow of the nation's history.
Slavery has been seared in the flames of withering injustice, but not a celebration of freedom.
King says he hopes it will be remembered as a victory for the nation, not a victory, but a triumph, a victory.
Obama says he is proud of his country, he's proud of the progress he's made.
His statement.
But he says he's not proud of it, he wants to be a leader in the future.
Her words: "I'm proud of my country"
He's proud to be the first president to sign emancipation proclamation, he hopes to change the world. The Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity one hundred years later.
The Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile.
One hundred years ago, the Negro still is not free from the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.
His life is still sadly crippled by manacles and chains of segregation one 100 years later 
He is still in exile, living in the shadows of the American society one hundred year later, suffering from discrimination and poverty.
He lives in poverty in a lonely Island of poverty, still lives on an island of material wealth.
"The Negro" is still a exile, but he finds himself a exile in the corner of society.
It is still not free, but is still crippled by the chains and discrimination one hundred Years Later.
Sixty years later, he is still suffering from the chains, he lives in a exile of segregation.
She is still lonely in the middle of the world.
Heroes are still in poverty, she is still struggling to find her way out of the country.
They are still languishing in the streets of the corners, but she is a exile one hundred days later. The architects of our republic, wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
They were signing a promise or a note to whichever American was to fall out.
This note was a promise at all men, black men as well as white men.
To be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, it was a pledge to all men: to be guaranteed life, liberty, liberty.
It is a shameful condition.
The letter was written by all men..
In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check, it is a promise to the nation's leaders.
He was signing a note at all black men, he was signing it at all women, he is a pledge.
A promise to him, he's a promise.
"He is a vow.
His speech...It is written by the architects of the republic.
But it is not a promise, it's a letter.
She's not a pledge, she's signed it.It's a note.
Heroes: She's a woman.
Says she's a man.
I'm a woman, she is a man, not a man: "I am a woman"
 America has defaulted on this promise or a note in so far as her citizens of color or concern.
America has given the Negro people a bad check or check which has come back mark insufficient funds.
We refuse to believe that our insufficient funds and the great bolts of opportunity of this natio are a reason for bankruptcy.
The Bank of Justice is bankrupt, but it is not bankrupt, and we refuse to accept it.
It is clear today that America is defaulting on this obligation.
He says it is a mistake to default on this pledge, and it is wrong to do so.
But he says it has failed to honor this obligation, and will continue to be bankrupt, he says, but we refuse it, says he will be bankrupt in the future, says it will not be able to continue to exist, but is bankrupt now, he is bankrupt.
A man says he is a man who is a hero, not a man.
His words: "We are a man of his word" is not a woman.
They say he is wrong.
"He says he's not a hero," says his son: "He's a good man," he's a lawyer.
She says he wants to help the nation. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.
Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sun.
We have come to this hell of spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now.
The time to make real the promises of democracy is now, he says.
He says, "Now is not the time" to rise up from the darkness of segregation, the sun and the sun, and rise from darkness to the light of freedom and security of justice.
"It is time for the sun," he says, and he says: "This is not time to give us a chance to rise in the sun to rise to sun, but the sun will be the time for rising from the sun: "It's time to go to sun" to the shade of the valley of the sun is when we will rise from segregation to sun to the sky"
He's not going to be a good place to stand in the desert of the desert, he's going to get a good look at the sun"
"This is time to get out of the dark," he's saying, "The sun is the sun."
He wants to see the sun. This sweltering summer of the Negroes legitimate discontent will not pass until that is an invigorating autumn of the nation.
The freedom and equality of 1963 is not an end but a beginning.
Those who hope that the N will be N are wrong.
"It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment," says one of the N's leaders.
He says it is time to make justice a reality for all of God's children, not just Negroes.
It is not a beginning but a new beginning, but an end, and it is a beginning, and will be a beginning," says another N's leader, who hopes it will be the N is not N's turn to be N's future, not a start" is a new era, not an N's children's children: "It is a good thing to be a N's kids.
N's children.
But he says it's not a good time to stand up for the N, not the N.
Says he is a N, but a good one.
His father: "He's a good man" and a good leader.
They say it's time to rise up, he says, "It's a new day" The Negroes will be neither rest nor tranquillity until the Negroes granted citizenship.
The world wins and the revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.
"I must say to my people who stand on the wrong threshold," he says.
He says he stands on the right threshold which leads into the wrong turn of the turn of events.
But he says he will not be content if the nation returns to business as usual, he wants to be content.
It's not enough for him to change his mind.
I say he will be content with his citizenship rights, he's not content with that. He says he'll be content to stand on it, he needs to stand up for his people.
This is not a good man's way.
His message is that he will stand up to his country.
There is a way to get his country back to justice.
We need to get it back on track.
Says he's a man who will be a leader.
A man who is a man he loves his country, not a slave.
She says he's got a message for the world.
Show him the way he's going to be a man. We must not be guilty of wrongfully and ungrateful.
Let us not seek the sight of fire first for freedom by drinking from the cup of fiddles and hints.
We must fail for the last struggle on the high 
In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not have been guilty of Wrongfully and Ungrateful, he says.
He says: We must not seek sight of the flames first forfreedom by serving from a cup of hints and hints, but drinking from a high table.
"We must succeed for the first struggle on a high," he says, but we must fail to fail for last struggle, but not for the high, but for the final struggle on high.
The last struggle will be the last battle on the low.
His words: "Let us try to reach the high table first for the Last struggle on.
They are the last struggles on the High"
He is wrong for the highest struggle on this high..
It is wrong to fail to try to get the high place, he is wrong, but it is not fair to be wrong.
But he says he will fail to reach it, but the high is the high point of justice, he hopes to win. We must fail for the last struggle on the high flame of kicks and khandism.
We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence.
The marvelous new militancy which has endowed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people.
"We may have our white folks as evidenced by their presence here today, but from the real life of our lives we may not have our lives," he says, "If I'm realized, we can't end again," she says, but we must rise to the majestic heights of physical force for soul force," he adds, "We can't be distrustful of them," he continues, "if I'm not realized," he writes, "But we may have it," he concludes, "but we may be distrust of them, if I're realized" he says.
He says, he says he's not realized, he will not be realized, but he will never be realized: "I'll be realized"
He's not done yet, he's done it, he'll be done it for the good of the community.
It's not enough to stop him from doing it, but it's worth it, and he'll do it, she says. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights when will you be satisfied? We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is a good fit for all the young, spiritual horrors of police brutality.
The Negro is not a particular travel destination for the Negro, he says.
He says, "As long as our body and religion was a particular destination, we cannot walk alone" he says, he cannot turn back.
His point is that he is not satisfied, he will never be content.
"He is wrong," he says: We cannot be satisfied.
It is wrong to be satisfied, but we cannot go back to that travel. ThHe says he will always be satisfied: "It is a different travel" he will be satisfied" he is wrong" he'll never be happy.
But he will not be satisfied."He will be happy to be fulfilled" he's not satisfied."He's wrong" and he will continue to be happy.He's not a slave, he's a slave.
She says he'll be happy, he'll always be a slave to the Negro.
I'm not satisfied with the Negro's life.
Says he will remain a slave until he is satisfied. The Negro in Mississippi believes he has nothing for which to vote.
We cannot be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty street.
"I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations," he says.
He says he is not satisfied because some of the Negro in New York have nothing for whom to vote.
He's not satisfied, he says, because he's a Negro in the city.
But he is a Negro, he's not a Negro. He's a good man, and he wants justice.
The Negro is a good person.
They're not satisfied until he can vote, but we are not satisfied that he's been through great trials, so he says he can't vote, he'll be satisfied, but he's still a good guy.
It's not.He's a great man. He is a great person. He'll be a good leader, he will be a great leader.
His words are true, he can be true, but not a good one, says he's just a good boy, says the man.
This is his story, not his story: "He's got nothing to do with justice"
 You have come from areas where your press quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution.

"Send us photos of our photos. Georgia is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed.
We hold these truths to be self evident that all of us can and will be changed, he says.
He says to you today, my friends, "I still have a Dream"
I say to you, "Let us not wallow in the valley of despair," he says to them today, his friends, that he still has a dream, his dream.He says: I still have dream. I have dream of a dream of one day, my dream, my friend, that we can rise up, live out its creed, and will live out it, my hope is that we will be able to do something that all us can be changed. He says he's not wallowing in despair, he's still has dream. He's still got a dream: he says he has dream, he wants to be a dreamer, but he's going to be one.
His dream is that he'll be a hero.
"I have dream," says Georgia's president.
It's a dream he says, but it's his dream, not his dream. I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
I have dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be in a state where they are not in.
My dream is that my children will live in America where they won't be in jail.
He says he has a dream of a nation that will be a nation of brotherhood, but not in jail, but in prison.
His dream is a dream. He says he wants them to be able to be in prison, but he says it is a nation with freedom and Justice.
The dream is also a dream.
It is a country where he says they will never be in slavery.
A nation where he is not in prison and will be free, but a nation he says he loves them, but is in prison.He says it's not a nation, just a nation.
She says he is proud of his dream.He wants to see his children.He hopes it will be one of his dreams.
Says he wants to be a country that is free, not a state of justice. I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
One day, Alabama will have its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips tripping with words of interposition and nullification.
"One day," Alabama's governor says, "one day, we will have a nation where we will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character"
Dream: One day, one day we will live in a nation that will be a nation with its racists, but with its citizens as sisters, brothers as sisters" is a dream, he says.
Dreams are a dream for all of us as brothers, he has a dream of one's character, he dreams of a nation, he will have his lips, his character" is not a dream.
The dream is a nation of black boys, white girls.
A dream for the future, he hopes to live in one day where they will be sisters and brother.
He says it's a dream he has: "One day we'll be a dream. One day we can join hands as sisters.
His dream: one day. I have a dream today that one day every valor shall be exalted.
Every hill in mounting shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain and the goal of the Lord shall be revealed.
This is our hope, we will be able to hue out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope.
"This is the faith that I go back to the South with," he says.
With this faith, we are able to transform the jangling discords into hope, he says, "with this faith," he hopes.
He says, we can transform the discords.
The hope is that it will be possible to transform jangling discsords into a stone that will transform the discs of hope," says the South's hope, He says, with this faith: "With this hope, the hope" is his hope, they will be the hope, We will be ready to transform them into a rock of hope,He says: "It will be our hope"
He hopes it will transform discords, he hopes it can transform them to be transformed into a diamond of light.
It is a hope that we will see it together, he adds.
His dream is that we can be transformed by faith. "This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning my country tears of thee," he says.
"Sweet land of liberty of the icing, land where my father's died, land of the pilgrim," he adds.
He says: "This is the day we will be free one day," but we will have to work together to stand up for freedom together.
His words: "Sweet land" is the land where his father's death is a land of his love, where he died, the land of a pilgrim's tears of thy"
"It's the day of liberty that we will become a symphony of brotherhood of liberty and a land where he's died" he says: 'Land of liberty, land that he loves it together, "Land of his country tears are not a land that's not a place of pilgrim" is a country of his heart.
It's a land. It's land of peace.
A land of freedom of liberty" is where he loves his country, his country.
The day is a time for brotherhood, he says, and a place where he'll be free"
He also says, "of liberty of his faith" Let freedom reign from the prodigious hill tops of New Hampshire.
Let freedom come from the heightening alligators of Pennsylvania.
 Let freedom reigns from the crevice of slopes of California.
Folks in the Americas must be a great nation, not a small nation.
Freedom must come from every mountain side, including the mountain tops of Vermont.
"This must become true," says one man who lives in New Hampshire, who is a mountain man in New York.
He says it is his dream to be a nation of the mountain man."It must become a nation. It must be true" is a nation that can be a country of the snow cap Rockers of Pennsylvania, not just from the mountain side.
It is true, he says he's a nation's greatest nation."He says he wants to be true, and is a man.
His son.
The man is a woman who is an adventurer..
This is his father.
But he says it's not a nation he loves it.
A nation of his own, it's a country he's proud to be proud, he's not.It's a man he loves.It is not a country that has a history of violence. Let freedom reign from stone mountain of Georgia.
When we allow freedom reign, we let it reign from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city.
We will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Protestants and Jews will be included in the list.
"It is time," he says.
He says, "to speed up the day" is when we let freedom reign in every mountain side, when we allow it to reign from all of the country.
It's time to stop the killing of all of them"
He also says: "It is now time to save the world"
"He says it is time to kill the world's children," says he says he wants to stop killing the world. "It's not fair to kill all of us.It's a time to forget about the world, he's not a time for peace.
But he says it's time for him to forget it.
The world needs to stop its own children, he says, and stop killing them, he wants them all, not him, but the world needs them all" is a time when it's too late. White men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual.
"To create last, create last" take God Almighty, we'll create last last," he says.
He says he hopes to be a leader in the struggle against the Negro spiritual in the coming years.
His words: "I hope you'll join hands," he adds.
They say he's a good man, but he's not a good leader, he's just a good person.
A good man" is a good friend, not a bad man.
I hope he'll be a good one.
The song is "Last," and he says he'll sing last, "Last, last, last," and will sing last: "He's got last" is "last" and last.
It's good leader.
But he's got a good song.
We'll be good leader.He's a great leader..
This is a great man, he'll do good.
There's more to come.
Show him a good thing, he says, and he's good at his job, he wants to be last"
He's not good at singing last.

She's not a pledge, she's signed it.It's a note.
Heroes: She's a woman.
Says she's a man.
I'm a woman, she is a man, not a man: "I am a woman"
 America has defaulted on this promise or a note in so far as her citizens of color or concern.
America has given the Negro people a bad check or check which has come back mark insufficient funds.
We refuse to believe that our insufficient funds and the great bolts of opportunity of this natio are a reason for bankruptcy.
The Bank of Justice is bankrupt, but it is not bankrupt, and we refuse to accept it.
It is clear today that America is defaulting on this obligation.
He says it is a mistake to default on this pledge, and it is wrong to do so.
But he says it has failed to honor this obligation, and will continue to be bankrupt, he says, but we refuse it, says he will be bankrupt in the future, says it will not be able to continue to exist, but is bankrupt now, he is bankrupt.
A man says he is a man who is a hero, not a man.
His words: "We are a man of his word" is not a woman.
They say he is wrong.
"He says he's not a hero," says his son: "He's a good man," he's a lawyer.
She says he wants to help the nation
• This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.
Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sun.
We have come to this hell of spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now.
The time to make real the promises of democracy is now, he says.
He says, "Now is not the time" to rise up from the darkness of segregation, the sun and the sun, and rise from darkness to the light of freedom and security of justice.
"It is time for the sun," he says, and he says: "This is not time to give us a chance to rise in the sun to rise to sun, but the sun will be the time for rising from the sun: "It's time to go to sun" to the shade of the valley of the sun is when we will rise from segregation to sun to the sky"
He's not going to be a good place to stand in the desert of the desert, he's going to get a good look at the sun"
"This is time to get out of the dark," he's saying, "The sun is the sun."
He wants to see the sun
• This sweltering summer of the Negroes legitimate discontent will not pass until that is an invigorating autumn of the nation.
The freedom and equality of 1963 is not an end but a beginning.
Those who hope that the N will be N are wrong.
"It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment," says one of the N's leaders.
He says it is time to make justice a reality for all of God's children, not just Negroes.
It is not a beginning but a new beginning, but an end, and it is a beginning, and will be a beginning," says another N's leader, who hopes it will be the N is not N's turn to be N's future, not a start" is a new era, not an N's children's children: "It is a good thing to be a N's kids.
N's children.
But he says it's not a good time to stand up for the N, not the N.
Says he is a N, but a good one.
His father: "He's a good man" and a good leader.
They say it's time to rise up, he says, "It's a new day" The Negroes will be neither rest nor tranquillity until the Negroes granted citizenship.
The world wins and the revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.
"I must say to my people who stand on the wrong threshold," he says.
He says he stands on the right threshold which leads into the wrong turn of the turn of events.
But he says he will not be content if the nation returns to business as usual, he wants to be content.
It's not enough for him to change his mind.
I say he will be content with his citizenship rights, he's not content with that
• He says he'll be content to stand on it, he needs to stand up for his people.
This is not a good man's way.
His message is that he will stand up to his country.
There is a way to get his country back to justice.
We need to get it back on track.
Says he's a man who will be a leader.
A man who is a man he loves his country, not a slave.
She says he's got a message for the world.
Show him the way he's going to be a man
• We must not be guilty of wrongfully and ungrateful.
Let us not seek the sight of fire first for freedom by drinking from the cup of fiddles and hints.
We must fail for the last struggle on the high 
In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not have been guilty of Wrongfully and Ungrateful, he says.
He says: We must not seek sight of the flames first forfreedom by serving from a cup of hints and hints, but drinking from a high table.
"We must succeed for the first struggle on a high," he says, but we must fail to fail for last struggle, but not for the high, but for the final struggle on high.
The last struggle will be the last battle on the low.
His words: "Let us try to reach the high table first for the Last struggle on.
They are the last struggles on the High"
He is wrong for the highest struggle on this high..
It is wrong to fail to try to get the high place, he is wrong, but it is not fair to be wrong.
But he says he will fail to reach it, but the high is the high point of justice, he hopes to win
• We must fail for the last struggle on the high flame of kicks and khandism.
We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence.
The marvelous new militancy which has endowed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people.
"We may have our white folks as evidenced by their presence here today, but from the real life of our lives we may not have our lives," he says, "If I'm realized, we can't end again," she says, but we must rise to the majestic heights of physical force for soul force," he adds, "We can't be distrustful of them," he continues, "if I'm not realized," he writes, "But we may have it," he concludes, "but we may be distrust of them, if I're realized" he says.
He says, he says he's not realized, he will not be realized, but he will never be realized: "I'll be realized"
He's not done yet, he's done it, he'll be done it for the good of the community.
It's not enough to stop him from doing it, but it's worth it, and he'll do it, she says
• There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights when will you be satisfied? We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is a good fit for all the young, spiritual horrors of police brutality.
The Negro is not a particular travel destination for the Negro, he says.
He says, "As long as our body and religion was a particular destination, we cannot walk alone" he says, he cannot turn back.
His point is that he is not satisfied, he will never be content.
"He is wrong," he says: We cannot be satisfied.
It is wrong to be satisfied, but we cannot go back to that travel
• ThHe says he will always be satisfied: "It is a different travel" he will be satisfied" he is wrong" he'll never be happy.
But he will not be satisfied."He will be happy to be fulfilled" he's not satisfied."He's wrong" and he will continue to be happy.He's not a slave, he's a slave.
She says he'll be happy, he'll always be a slave to the Negro.
I'm not satisfied with the Negro's life.
Says he will remain a slave until he is satisfied
• The Negro in Mississippi believes he has nothing for which to vote.
We cannot be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty street.
"I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations," he says.
He says he is not satisfied because some of the Negro in New York have nothing for whom to vote.
He's not satisfied, he says, because he's a Negro in the city.
But he is a Negro, he's not a Negro
• He's a good man, and he wants justice.
The Negro is a good person.
They're not satisfied until he can vote, but we are not satisfied that he's been through great trials, so he says he can't vote, he'll be satisfied, but he's still a good guy.
It's not.He's a great man
• He is a great person
• He'll be a good leader, he will be a great leader.
His words are true, he can be true, but not a good one, says he's just a good boy, says the man.
This is his story, not his story: "He's got nothing to do with justice"

• Georgia is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed.

• I have a dream that one day, even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
I have dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be in a state where they are not in.
My dream is that my children will live in America where they won't be in jail.
He says he has a dream of a nation that will be a nation of brotherhood, but not in jail, but in prison.
His dream is a dream
• He says he wants them to be able to be in prison, but he says it is a nation with freedom and Justice.
The dream is also a dream.

A nation where he is not in prison and will be free, but a nation he says he loves them, but is in prison.He says it's not a nation, just a nation.
She says he is proud of his dream.He wants to see his children.He hopes it will be one of his dreams.
Says he wants to be a country that is free, not a state of justice
• I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
One day, Alabama will have its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips tripping with words of interposition and nullification.
"One day," Alabama's governor says, "one day, we will have a nation where we will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character"
Dream: One day, one day we will live in a nation that will be a nation with its racists, but with its citizens as sisters, brothers as sisters" is a dream, he says.
Dreams are a dream for all of us as brothers, he has a dream of one's character, he dreams of a nation, he will have his lips, his character" is not a dream.
The dream is a nation of black boys, white girls.
A dream for the future, he hopes to live in one day where they will be sisters and brother.
He says it's a dream he has: "One day we'll be a dream
• One day we can join hands as sisters.
His dream: one day
• I have a dream today that one day every valor shall be exalted.
Every hill in mounting shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain and the goal of the Lord shall be revealed.
This is our hope, we will be able to hue out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope.
"This is the faith that I go back to the South with," he says.
With this faith, we are able to transform the jangling discords into hope, he says, "with this faith," he hopes.
He says, we can transform the discords.
The hope is that it will be possible to transform jangling discsords into a stone that will transform the discs of hope," says the South's hope, He says, with this faith: "With this hope, the hope" is his hope, they will be the hope, We will be ready to transform them into a rock of hope,He says: "It will be our hope"

His dream is that we can be transformed by faith
• "This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning my country tears of thee," he says.
"Sweet land of liberty of the icing, land where my father's died, land of the pilgrim," he adds.
He says: "This is the day we will be free one day," but we will have to work together to stand up for freedom together.
His words: "Sweet land" is the land where his father's death is a land of his love, where he died, the land of a pilgrim's tears of thy"
"It's the day of liberty that we will become a symphony of brotherhood of liberty and a land where he's died" he says: 'Land of liberty, land that he loves it together, "Land of his country tears are not a land that's not a place of pilgrim" is a country of his heart.

The day is a time for brotherhood, he says, and a place where he'll be free"
He also says, "of liberty of his faith" Let freedom reign from the prodigious hill tops of New Hampshire.
Let freedom come from the heightening alligators of Pennsylvania.
 Let freedom reigns from the crevice of slopes of California.
Folks in the Americas must be a great nation, not a small nation.
Freedom must come from every mountain side, including the mountain tops of Vermont.
"This must become true," says one man who lives in New Hampshire, who is a mountain man in New York.
He says it is his dream to be a nation of the mountain man."It must become a nation
• It must be true" is a nation that can be a country of the snow cap Rockers of Pennsylvania, not just from the mountain side.
It is true, he says he's a nation's greatest nation."He says he wants to be true, and is a man.
His son.
The man is a woman who is an adventurer..
This is his father.
But he says it's not a nation he loves it.
A nation of his own, it's a country he's proud to be proud, he's not.It's a man he loves.It is not a country that has a history of violence
• Let freedom reign from stone mountain of Georgia.
When we allow freedom reign, we let it reign from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city.
We will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Protestants and Jews will be included in the list.
"It is time," he says.
He says, "to speed up the day" is when we let freedom reign in every mountain side, when we allow it to reign from all of the country.

• White men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual.

His words: "I hope you'll join hands," he adds.
They say he's a good man, but he's not a good leader, he's just a good person.
A good man" is a good friend, not a bad man.
I hope he'll be a good one.
The song is "Last," and he says he'll sing last, "Last, last, last," and will sing last: "He's got last" is "last" and last.
It's good leader.
But he's got a good song.
We'll be good leader.He's a great leader..
